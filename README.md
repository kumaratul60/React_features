# React_features
 1. Basic of HTLM, CSS, JS and Learn Props and Hooks 
 
2. Fundamentals of NodeJS, import, and Export Keyword
 
Whilst being a React Developer you will run a lot of NPM scripts/Commands, so the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) should be clear to you.
NPM (Node Package Manager): You should have knowledge of NPM. It is used to install the Node Modules and packages. Learn how to use the commands/scripts to install the packages and modules. There is also another Package manager called Yarn that can be used.

Import Keyword: Used to install Node Modules.

Export Keyword: Used when you're creating a module/component and you have to return a part of it.

3. Learn React Fundamentals

Once the above concepts are clear and you have become confident with JavaScript then learn the fundamentals of Core React. You will have to divide the complete UI or JSX into reusable components.
Now the question is…What are the core concepts you should learn in ReactJS Let’s discuss that…
You’ll be using JSX Syntax in ReactJS. Syntax of JSX is somewhat similar to HTML but keep in mind that it is different from plain HTML.
Learn the concepts of State in ReactJS? How does it work? and learn how to store and update the data in the state.
In React, you will be using props. We know that this might be a new word for you. So, it is being used for passing data from one component to another. But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow.

4. Learn to fetch data from both REST and GraphQL APIs

You have to learn how a user interacts with the backend. The backend is where we get our data from and do other things like authenticate user.
There are two ways of working with data. The first way of getting data is called a REST API. REST APIs are the most common form of API and the second way is using GRAPHQL API.

5. Learn How to style you're React app with a component library or utility class.

Every React app needs styling for its appearance, One choice is to use Plain CSS. You can write your own styles and put them in a separate style sheet.
A Component library gives us reusable components that have their own pre-made styles. The most popular component for React is Material UI. But there are many others you can choose from.
You can style your app by applying class names to each element. This removes the need to write any style yourself. The most popular utility class library is Tailwind CSS.

6. Learn React Hooks

Learn this React Hooks, it allows you to write less code and that makes your app efficient, simpler, and powerful.

useState: Most of the time in your React app you will be using This concept to store and manage the data.

useRef: This will be used to reference jsx elements.

useContext: This property of React Hooks will be used to access data from React context to share the data among components easily (instead of passing props)

useReducer: This concept in React hooks will be used to store and manage data across multiple components.

useEffect: You will be using this concept in actions like HTTP requests and working with the browser API.

7. Manage State in React with React Context

What is State Management? It’s the process of deciding where to locate data and how to work with it across our app. To manage state across our app. To manage state across your app components, use React Context.

What about Redux? Redux is a popular library for managing state in React apps. It is a far more complex tool than you need for most apps you'll build. While Redux is still relied upon for very large applications. React Context will be enough for any app you make.
